##### 1.

Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.


Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]

Output: true

Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.


##### 2. 

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters


Input: "Tact Coa"

Output: True(permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta")

##### Bonus (This is a lot harder than the others)

Given an array of numbers ranging from 2-9, return all possible letter combinations that the numbers could represent.
