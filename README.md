##### 1.

Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.


Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]

Output: true

Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.




##### 2 . (This is a lot harder than the 1st one)

Given an array of numbers ranging from 2-9, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent.
